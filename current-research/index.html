<p><strong>When should the majority rule? Experimental evidence for Madisonian judgments in five cultures</strong> (with Honorata Mazepus, Scott Bokemper, &amp; Peter DeScioli) <em>Revise and Resubmit at the Journal of Experimental Political Science</em> <a href="/assets/pdf/bor_madison_web.pdf">PDF</a>.</p>

<p>Societies need to make collective decisions even when individuals disagree. In diverse settings from governments to small groups, people use multiple basic rules for collective choice including voting, consensus, leadership, and chance, along with many intricate elaborations of these rules. Here we study the psychology behind how people think that groups should decide, focusing especially on when they think voting is appropriate. Participants in five countries read scenarios about a small group that needs to make a collective decision even though they disagree. In a between-subject design, we manipulated whether the group had a vulnerable minority—a smaller number of people who had more at stake than the majority. We find that participants from all five countries generally preferred majority-rule voting for collective decisions, but when the group included a vulnerable minority, participants opposed voting and instead preferred consensus for making the group’s choice. We discuss implications for how people judge the legitimacy of voting as a rule for resolving societal disagreements.</p>

<p><strong>The Psychology of Online Political Hostility: A Comprehensive, Cross-National Test of the Mismatch Hypothesis</strong> (with Michael Bang Petersen) <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/hwb83/">Pre-print</a></p>

<p>Why are online discussions about politics experienced as more hostile than offline discussions? A popular answer builds on the argument that human psychology is tailored for face-to-face interaction and, accordingly, people’s behavior changes for the worse in impersonal online discussions. We provide the first theoretical formalization and empirical test of this explanation: the mismatch hypothesis. We argue that mismatches between human psychology and novel features of online communication environments could (a) change people’s behavior, (b) bias their perceptions and (c) create adverse selection effects. We leverage five cross-national representative surveys and online behavioral experiments (total N=7510) to test the mismatch hypothesis but find little to no evidence. Rather, we find that online political hostility reflects the behavior of individuals predisposed to be hostile in all (including offline) contexts. Yet, because their behavior is more likely to be witnessed on public online platforms, these are perceived to induce more hostility.</p>

<p><strong>Empathy, deservingness, and preferences for welfare assistance: A large-scale online perspective-taking experiment</strong> (with Gábor Simonovits) <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/d4sm9/">Pre-print</a></p>

<p>Online perspective-taking experiments have demonstrated great potential in reducing prejudice towards disadvantaged groups such as refugees or the Roma. These studies trigger the psychological process of empathy and evoke feelings of compassion. Meanwhile, a growing literature argues that compassion towards the poor is an important predictor of support for social welfare. This paper bridges these two literatures and predicts that perspective-taking with the poor could increase support for welfare assistance. This hypothesis is tested with a pre-registered experiment conducted on a large and diverse online sample of US citizens (N=3,431). Our results suggest that participants engaged with the perspective-taking exercise, wrote eloquent, often emotional essays. Nevertheless, perspective-taking had no meaningful causal effect on social welfare attitudes; we can confidently rule out effects exceeding 2 points on a 100 points scale. These results cast serious doubt on perspective-taking as a viable online tool to create compassion towards the poor.</p>

<p><strong>Ignorant, disruptive or polarized?Psychological motivations behind “fake news” sharing</strong> (with Mathias Osmundsen, Anja Bechmann, Peter Bjerregaard, Mathias Osmundsen, and Michael Bang Petersen)</p>

<p>The apparent rise of fake news is a major concern in contemporary Western democracies. Accordingly, great efforts have been devoted to combating fake news. Yet, we know littleabout the psychological motivations behind spreading fake news stories on social media. Are citizens sharing fake newsignorantand lazy? Or are they fueled by sinister motives,seeking todisruptthe democratic political order or to attack partisan opponents in an increasingly polarized political culture? This paper makes the first attempt to test these competing hypotheses by relying on a novel dataset linking behavioral data to a surveycarefully mapping psychological variables for over 2,300 American Twitter users. We find little to no support for the ignorance and disruption hypotheses, but firm evidence for the polarization hypothesis. Overall, motivations to share fake news may be less different from motivations to share other political news stories than commonly assumed.</p>

<p><strong>Fighting fake news with educational videos – An experiment on a Twitter-panel</strong> (with Anja Bechmann, Mathias Osmundsen, Michael Bang Petersen, and Stig Hebbelstrup Rye Rasmussen)</p>

<p>“Fake news” are widely acknowledged as an important challenge for Western democracies. Yet, surprisingly little effort has been devoted to designing and measuring the effect of various counter-strategies. Here, we address this void by running a pre-registered experiment analyzing the causal effects of popular, professional anti-“fake news” educational videos on YouTube. We experimentally manipulate exposure to an educational video in a unique panel of Twitter users (N = ~1800) who completed background surveys with detailed psychological profiling and gave informed consent to link these data to their scraped Twitter feeds. We measure the causal effect of watching the video on performance in a “fake news” quiz immediately after exposure and on the sharing links from verified “fake news” websites on Twitter in the months following the exposure.</p>

<p><strong>Partisan motivation and candidate traits - Trustworthiness matters more for out-party than in-party candidate evaluations.</strong> (with Lasse Laustsen) <a href="/assets/pdf/Bor_Laustsen_web.pdf">PDF</a>.</p>

<p>It is well known that partisans are biased to view their own candidates through rose-colored glasses but see competing candidates in a much more negative light. However, recent advances in political behavior research reveal that motivated reasoning is not simply about love and hate but may also promote more nuanced shifts in preferences. We incorporate this insight into the novel trend of studying the importance of specific character traits on candidate evaluations. Specifically, we propose that as the ill intentions of an out-party candidate are much more likely to be costly for a voter than similar intentions of an in-party candidate, people need to pay special attention to the former’s trustworthiness. We test this prediction using all available representative election surveys including voter impressions of candidate trustworthiness encompassing twenty-three elections from a diverse set of seven countries (Australia, Denmark, Germany, Norway, Sweden, UK, and USA) and spanning two decades. We find that trustworthiness in out-party candidates is consistently more strongly associated with global candidate evaluations than for in-party candidates. Importantly, the heterogeneous role played by trustworthiness in out- and in-party candidate evaluations is contrasted with competence and strong leadership, two other influential character traits in candidate evaluations, which are not weighted more heavily for out-party candidates. The results stress the importance of applying a multifaceted framework of candidate character and that impressions of trustworthiness, in particular, are intertwined with partisan-based reasoning about candidates. We conclude by discussing the implications of the results for models of candidate evaluations, party switching and citizens’ acceptance of authoritative decisions.</p>

<p><strong>Quantifying dynamic responsiveness: Evidence from minimum wage laws</strong> (with Gábor Simonovits)</p>

<p>To what extent does policy change reflect changes in mass preferences in U.S. states? Current approaches fail to quantify dynamic responsiveness because they fail to compare preferences and policies on meaningful scales or lack re- peated measures on opinion and policy. In this note, we overcome this issue by estimating Americans’ preferences on the minimum wage and compare them to observed policies in each state from 2013 to 2019. As we measure both preferences and policies on the same scale, we can quantify the association be- tween changes in policy outcomes an preferences within states. Moreover, we can also use the resulting data to track policy bias. We demonstrate that while minimum wages laws respond to corresponding changes in preferences such dy- namic responsiveness does little to reduce policy bias. While the fixed-effect regressions indicate that the average relationship between preference change and policy change was close to 1, policy bias remained relatively stable, ranging from $1.75 to $2.25.</p>
